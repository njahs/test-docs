# Deformable Mesh (Asset)

The *Deformable Mesh* is created / maintained in the [Deformation Data Tool](../mesh-tool/overview.md) and used by the [Deformable Mesh Component](../mesh-component/overview.md). It is a normal *uasset* (Unreal Data Asset), i.e. references are handled by unreal and you can access the deformable meshes via the content browser.

*We previously (version < 2.0) used DataTables. That implementation had some flaws that are fixed by using unreal data assets*
