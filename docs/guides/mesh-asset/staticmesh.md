When it comes to the static mesh that's used for the deformable mesh, the following aspects should be taken into account:

- Your static mesh **SHOULD NOT** have overlapping vertices / faces / edges!

</details>

- Your static mesh **SHOULD NOT** consist of many separate objects! The static mesh **SHOULD** be joint together for good deformation!
<details>
    <summary>Example: Not connected parts</summary>
    <img src={NotConnected} />
    The numberplate is being "pushed into" the back of this vehicle. Why? Because it's not connected to the back of the vehicle:
    <img src={NotConnectedBlender} style={{width: 400}} />
</details>

- Your static mesh **NEEDS** vertices wherever deformation should take place! *No / too less vertices = No / bad deformation.*
<details>
    <summary>Example: Not enough vertices</summary>
    <img src={NoDeformation} />
    That part of the mesh only has 4 vertices and that is not enough for any deformation!

- When using [**attachments**](../../advanced-guides/attachments.md) make sure your static meshes are **NOT ONE SIDED** (*= only visible from one side and invisible / transparent from the other side*), in the event that the static mesh falls off you can see both sides.
