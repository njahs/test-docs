# Explorer

import Groups from './img/tool-groups.png';
import Viewport from './img/tool-viewport.png';
import ViewportVertex from './img/tool-viewport-vertex.png';

The *Explorer* has two parts, the Viewport and the Groups overview.

## Viewport

<div style={{display: "flex", maxWidth: "100%"}}>
    <img src={Viewport} style={{width: "50%"}} />
    <img src={ViewportVertex} style={{width: "50%"}} />
</div>
<div style={{display: "flex", maxWidth: "100%"}}>
    <div style={{width: "50%"}}>Normal mode</div>
    <div style={{width: "50%"}}>*Vertexmode* activated</div>
</div>
<br/>

The viewport is simple: It displays the selected deformable mesh. At the moment we use a procedural mesh to display the deformable mesh regardless of whether the actual deformation component uses a realtime mesh or not. The following options can be changed (they are located on the right):
- The viewport can be turned on and off using the **Viewport** button 
- You can also choose what **LOD** to show in the viewport (only available when using RMC).
- You can preview the group distribution using the **Vertexmode**. This will apply a custom material to the viewport mesh that'll display the different groups using different colors. In this mode you can de-/select single or multiple groups in the groups list and only the selected groups will be colorized.

## Groups and options

<img src={Groups} style={{width:  "50%"}} />

In the upper part of this section you have the viewport options. Below that you have detailed information about the groups of the [deformable mesh (asset)](../mesh-asset/overview.md), how many groups were created, how many vertices the mesh has and a list of all groups.
