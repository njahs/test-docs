# Setup

import CompTree from './img/comp-tree.png';
import CompAdd from './img/comp-add.png';

In this topic we will use a static mesh actor and add deformation to it.

:::tip
This only describes the most basic setup. [Chaos Vehicles](../../advanced-guides/chaos-vehicle.md) and [AVS Vehicles](../../advanced-guides/advanced-vehicle-system.md) have a own topic.
:::

1. Decide what static mesh you want to deform and create a [Deformable Mesh](../mesh-asset/overview.md) using the [Deformation Data Tool](../mesh-tool/asset-management.md#create-a-new-deformable-mesh).
2. Add a **Deformable Mesh Component** to your actor **below** the static mesh that you want to deform:<br/><img src={CompAdd} /><br/>
    It should look like this (we want to deform the "*StaticMesh*"):<br/><img src={CompTree} style={{verticalAlign: "top"}} />
3. Make sure the "*StaticMesh*" (the parent of Deformable Mesh Component)...
    - ... is visible / not hidden
    - ... displays the correct static mesh (same as the deformable mesh)
    - ... has collision enabled
    - ... in case of a skeletal mesh: has "*Simulation Generates Hit Events*" checked
4. Select the recently created *Deformable Mesh Component* (**BP_DeformableMeshComp**) and configure it (see [Settings](settings.md)). The most important settings are:
    - *[**MANDATORY**] Settings - Deformable Mesh*: Here you have to select your Deformable Mesh (created in Step 1)
    - *Settings - Deformation - None Physics - Mass Override*: This is **MANDATORY** in case your static mesh does NOT simulate physics.
